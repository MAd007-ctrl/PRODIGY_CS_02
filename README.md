# PRODIGY_CS_02
This Python script uses the pixel manipulation to encrypt and decrypt images. It swaps the red and blue channels of each pixel in the image to create the encrypted version and reverses the process to decrypt it. The program takes an image file, processes it, and generates both encrypted and decrypted image outputs.
